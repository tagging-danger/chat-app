**Direct Connect** is a modern, privacy-first peer-to-peer web app for instant, direct sharing and chat. No server, no registration, no data stored. Built with WebRTC (PeerJS), it enables secure, direct communication between browsers with end-to-end encryption (E2EE). This is ideal for quick, private exchanges.
